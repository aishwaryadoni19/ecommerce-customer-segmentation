# 🛍️ E-commerce Customer Segmentation using Python

This repository presents a complete end-to-end project on customer segmentation for an e-commerce platform. The work was completed as part of the ALY6140 Python Capstone course at Northeastern University.

We used Python to explore, analyze, and segment customer data based on purchasing behavior. The results help businesses tailor marketing strategies to different customer segments more effectively.
